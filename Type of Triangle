Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

select case 
    when a+b <=c or b+c <=a or c+a <=b then 'Not A Triangle'
    when a=b and b=c then 'Equilateral'
    when a=b or b=c or c=a then 'Isosceles'  
    else 'Scalene'
end as result
from triangles;
