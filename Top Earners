We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly (salary * months) worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as 2 space-separated integers.

select max(months * salary), count(employee_id) 
from employee 
where (months * salary) = (select max(months * salary) from employee)
